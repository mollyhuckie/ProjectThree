# ProjectThree

This project is an app to make assigning & completing chores easier for parent & child. The app uses react, mySQL, routing, express, & of course css. I focused on building up the html & designing the css. I think that is overall needed to be minimalistic to focus on the tasks assigned yet still pleasing to look at. Attached below is my screen recording.
